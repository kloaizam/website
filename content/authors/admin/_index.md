I am an economist with research interests in machine learning techniques to improve forecasts and measure expectations, the role of expectations in explaining macroeconomic dynamics, and the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy and their transmission channels. I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Indiana University, Bloomington.
